# 🌍 Delhi Climate Trend Analysis (2013-2017) 🌡️

## Overview 👁️
This repository houses the Delhi Climate Trend Analysis project, which focuses on the comprehensive study of climate parameters in Delhi, India, from 2013 to 2017. The primary aim is to explore and understand the patterns and trends in climate variables using detailed econometric methods.

## Objectives 🎯
- **Trend Analysis**: Examine the temporal trends of climate variables such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure.
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Identify seasonal variations and their impact on climate behavior.
- **Data Integrity**: Assess and clean the dataset to ensure accurate analysis.

## Methodology 🔍
The project employs time series analysis techniques to explore the relationships and trends within the climate data. Methods include:
- **Descriptive Statistics**: For initial data understanding.
- **Time Series Decomposition**: To observe underlying patterns.
- **ADF Tests**: Conducted to check the stationarity of the series.

### Data Analysis 📊
The analysis begins with data preprocessing, including handling missing values and outliers, followed by:
- **Visualization**: Using plots to visually represent trends and relationships.
- **Statistical Tests**: To verify assumptions and infer conclusions.

## Results 📈
Findings highlight significant seasonal effects on temperature and humidity levels, with detailed regression outputs indicating how each variable contributes to changes in climate indicators.

## Tools and Libraries Used 🛠️
- **R Programming**: For all data manipulation, statistical modeling, and visualization.
